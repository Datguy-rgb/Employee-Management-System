# Project Problem Statement & Scope

## Problem Statement
In many small-scale organizations, employee records are still maintained using manual file systems or disorganized spreadsheets. This leads to issues such as data redundancy, difficulty in searching for specific employee details, and a lack of data validation. There is a need for a lightweight, digital system to streamline these operations.

## Scope of the Project
The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a Python-based console application designed to handle the lifecycle of employee data. It allows administrators to securely log in, create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) employee records. The system uses efficient Python data structures (dictionaries) for fast data retrieval and manipulation.

## Target Users
* **HR Managers:** To maintain current employee records.
* **System Administrators:** To manage system access and data integrity.

## High-Level Features
* **Secure Authentication:** User login system to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Employee CRUD Operations:** Add, View, Update, and Remove employees.
* **Search Functionality:** Instant lookup of employees by ID.
* **Data Validation:** Regex-based validation for Emails and Phone numbers.
* **Salary Management:** Feature to promote employees (increase salary).
